# Student Behavior Analysis Report

## Introduction
This report presents the findings from an exploratory data analysis and k-means clustering of a dataset concerning student behavior. The dataset includes various metrics indicative of student engagement, such as the number of times students raised their hands, visited resources, viewed announcements, and participated in discussions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Categorical Data Distributions

- **Gender**: Includes both male (M) and female (F) students, with 175 entries for females.
- **Nationality and Place of Birth**: Represents a wide range of nationalities and places of birth, indicating diverse cultural backgrounds.
- **Academic Stages**: Includes lower level, middle school, and high school.
- **GradeID**: Spans from G-02 to G-12.
- **SectionID**: Distributed across three sections: A, B, and C.
- **Topic**: Covers subjects like IT, Math, Arabic, Science, English, among others.
- **Semester**: Covers both the first (F) and second (S) semesters.
- **Parental Engagement**: Includes metrics like parent answering survey and parental satisfaction with the school.


The dataset comprises several categorical and numerical features representing different aspects of student behavior and demographics. Key findings from the exploratory data analysis include:
- The dataset contains no missing values, indicating completeness across all features.
- Numerical features exhibit a wide range of engagement levels among students, with significant variance in behaviors such as raising hands and visiting resources.

  ### Histogram
  ![Image Alt Text](figures1/fig1.png)

- Raisedhands:
This histogram shows a bimodal distribution, with peaks around 10 and 70. This suggests there are two groups of students - those who rarely raise their hands and those who do so frequently.
 - VisitedResources:
The histogram for VisITedResources appears right-skewed, indicating that while many students visit resources frequently (peaks around 80-100), there's a significant number who do not engage as often.
 - AnnouncementsView:
The distribution for AnnouncementsView is less clear, but there appears to be a slight left skewness, with fewer students checking announcements very frequently, and more students doing so moderately.
 - Discussion:
The Discussion histogram is somewhat uniform but shows slight peaks around 20 and 70, suggesting that while student participation in discussions is spread out across different frequencies, there are concentrations of students who participate either moderately or very actively.

## K-Means Clustering
K-means clustering was applied to segment the students based on their engagement metrics. The Elbow Method suggested that 2 or 3 clusters provide a meaningful segmentation of the data.

### Clustering Results

![Image Alt Text](figures1/fig4.png)
- **With 2 Clusters:**
  - Cluster 0 identifies students with lower overall engagement.
  - Cluster 1 includes students with higher engagement across all metrics.

- **With 3 Clusters:**
  - Cluster 0 (Highly Engaged): Students exhibit high engagement in all activities.
  - Cluster 1 (Low Engagement): Students show minimal engagement.
  - Cluster 2 (Moderately Engaged): Students are particularly active in resource visiting but less so in other areas.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
The analysis reveals distinct segments within the student population based on their engagement levels. These insights can inform targeted strategies to enhance educational outcomes. Recommendations for interventions are tailored to each cluster's characteristics, aiming to boost engagement and participation.

### Recommendations for Educational Strategies
- Highly Engaged Students (Cluster 0 in 3-cluster solution): Continue to provide challenging and engaging materials and opportunities for discussions to keep these students stimulated.
- Low Engagement Students (Cluster 1 in 3-cluster solution): Implement interventions aimed at increasing engagement, such as personalized learning paths, gamification, and more interactive resources.
- Moderately Engaged Students (Cluster 2 in 3-cluster solution): Encourage more participation in discussions and classroom activities through group projects or peer-learning opportunities to increase their overall engagement.
This detailed analysis and the insights derived from it could be incorporated into a comprehensive report for stakeholders interested in improving student engagement and learning outcomes.
