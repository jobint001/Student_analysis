# Student Behavior Analysis Report

## Introduction
This report presents the findings from an exploratory data analysis and k-means clustering of a dataset concerning student behavior. The dataset includes various metrics indicative of student engagement, such as the number of times students raised their hands, visited resources, viewed announcements, and participated in discussions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis Summary
The dataset comprises several categorical and numerical features representing different aspects of student behavior and demographics. Key findings from the exploratory data analysis include:
- The dataset contains no missing values, indicating completeness across all features.
- Numerical features exhibit a wide range of engagement levels among students, with significant variance in behaviors such as raising hands and visiting resources.

## K-Means Clustering
K-means clustering was applied to segment the students based on their engagement metrics. The Elbow Method suggested that 2 or 3 clusters provide a meaningful segmentation of the data.

### Clustering Results
- **With 2 Clusters:**
  - Cluster 0 identifies students with lower overall engagement.
  - Cluster 1 includes students with higher engagement across all metrics.

- **With 3 Clusters:**
  - Cluster 0 (Highly Engaged): Students exhibit high engagement in all activities.
  - Cluster 1 (Low Engagement): Students show minimal engagement.
  - Cluster 2 (Moderately Engaged): Students are particularly active in resource visiting but less so in other areas.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
The analysis reveals distinct segments within the student population based on their engagement levels. These insights can inform targeted strategies to enhance educational outcomes. Recommendations for interventions are tailored to each cluster's characteristics, aiming to boost engagement and participation.

For a detailed strategy implementation and further analysis, stakeholders are encouraged to consider the nuances of each cluster.
